" An overwhelming sense of paranoia leads one of the party to the conclusion that there is a mole within the party leaking info to the denizens of Chaos.

Outside behind some ivy a window (which also doesn't open) is found there is movement inside though the grime and dust don't allow anything clear to be seen. One night creaking hinges are dreamt of. The next day furniture is found moved about and there are finger gouges in the butter. A smell of old sour flowers/orange peel pervades the air... The next night footsteps are also heard which beat a hasty retreat to the room when the character tries to catch a glimpse of their owner. The contents of the larder and refrigerator are decimated, it becomes clear that the occupant of the room is a carnivore. The grime from the window is day by day clearing a figure with long white/grey hair is made out, or is it just cobwebs being blown about.

A ship goes missing in the Atlantic somewhere, dubbed `The New Titanic` as the last report details a large iceberg in the distance, and the sea being like blood.

" (again for the Brits and Europeans, If that damn frog didn't make it to America, I envy you!) An irritating yet catchy new ringtone is spreading like wildfire among children and adults alike, and you can't walk down the high street without hearing it at least once.

" A math teacher finds one of his students commited suicide while working on a coursework assignment on Pi, having tried to proove that it is possible to create a strange bent circle with Pi being exactly three.

" A bomb goes off in a hotel. Running out of the wreckage is a man totally aflame clutching a gigantic, thin book that will not burn. It is filled with large, colour and black-and-white photographs of paintings and sculpture from an obscure Surrealist exhibition from the 1950's, along with photos of the artist presenting their work or just hanging out. The burning man is identified as the publisher of the book, printed 1969, which seems amazingly new; The pages are still glossy, lacking even the faintest fingerprints, and the pictures are incredibly clear. However, few art critics recognise the names of the artists. The whole thing is quite extraordinary, since not only are the pieces some of the most brilliant and avant-garde examples of the genre, but all the contributers, members of an esteemed company of former Dadaists, disappeared, were presumed dead, or commited suicide by December 31st, 1949.",

" You are invited to attend a gallery opening of paintings by a young, up-and-coming artist. When you arrive at the gallery, the artist seems anxious, paranoid. You're not sure why. Until a raving lunatic comes in screaming such phrases as `Have you seen it? The Yellow Sign!

What will you do when the Police arrive? 137. You open your eyes and the sun is shining through your window, the breeze blows gently and the curtains sway.

Or is there something more ancient and evil guiding these events? 140. The investigators car breaks down in a small town. The town seems unchanged since the 1950s and lacks many modern amenities. All of the townsfolk seem very helpful and kind, quick to try and get the investigators car back in working order and get them to leave.

" The players are contacted by a mutual friend who is a writer for a paranormal magazine. He has been investigating a story of a humanoid creature said to have been seen by locals in a rundown old fairground on the outskirts of a fairly remote coastal cliff town. He tells them that the locals have been trying to get the place condemned and demolished for some time but the ownwer, Mr Brinkley, wont sell the land for any price and wont explain why. The `creature` started to appear after some of the men in the town tried to do some unofficial demolition, blowing up one of the smaller rides with dynamite. The explosion apparently revealed a deep hole which may connect to some sort of underground caverns. The monster itself is described as `kinda like the creature from the black lagoon, you know, from the movies, but a lot bigger!` The players writer friend asks for the groups help in investigating the creature. If it could be captured on film or, better still, captured itself, it would be the scientific discovery of the age and make them all famous, not to mention rich. When the players arrive at the town, a few days later, they find that their friend is missing. The landlady of the guest house he was staying at says he went out for a walk along the cliffs two days ago and has not been seen since. Worse still, there has been a grisly discovery at the fairground. The eviscerated corpses of four teenagers, two male, two female, were found dumped unceremoniously outside the fairground gates. They weren't local kids, the brightly decorated van they apparently travelled in was parked nearby. Even the large dog, probably a great dane, they had with them was unable to protect them. It's headless, bloated body was found washed up on the beach that very morning by deputies out looking for the players friend. The locals are terrified. The men of the town want to hurl as much dynamite as they can into the fairground from outside, hoping to collapse the creature's way to the surface but Mr Brinkley, who lives on the site, has shut himself up in his home and isn't answering his phone. There is also the chance that the players's friend is still alive.
