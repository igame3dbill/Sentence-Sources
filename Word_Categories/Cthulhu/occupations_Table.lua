occupations={{"ANTIQUARIAN",[[he revels in the timeless excellence of design and
execution, and in the power of ancient lore, the most Lovecraft-like
occupation. The antiquarian rarely deals in what he loves. More often,
an independent income allows him to sharpen and define
his pleasure in things old and obscure. He has an appreciative
eye and a swift mind, and frequently finds mordant or
contemptuous humor in the foolishness of the ignorant, the
pompous, and the greedy,or are those perceptions clues to
his own mental instability? Occasionally female, though usually
too obsessive and voyeuristic to be of that sex.]]},

{"ARTIST",[[he is self-absorbed with his own visions, but is
blessed with a talent that lets him express himself. Often
he also has a crafty entrepreneurial streak. Usually a
painter or sculptor but, by the present day, academic
infusions have so enwrapped the fine arts that technique
has become less important than concept or the ability to
write a grant proposal. Talented or not, the artistÅfs ego must
be hardy and strong to surmount initial obstacles and to keep
him working if success arrives. This occupation is equally available
to males and females.]]},

{"AUTHOR",[[as distinct from the journalist,
the author uses words to define and explore the
conditions of human life, and especially the range of
human emotions. It is said that an author does not so
much write as rewrite; his labors are solitary and his
rewards solipsistic: only a relative handful make much
money in the present day, though in previous eras the trade once
provided livable wages. The work habits of authors vary
widely. Typically an author withdraws during periods of
intense creation. The author who is constantly expansive and
sociable is written-out, or perhaps had no talent to start with.
May be male or female.]]},

{"DILETTANTE",[[the dilettante has so much money that specialists are
needed to take care of it. He or she is well educated, though not systematically
educated or necessarily accomplished in anything. Money
frees the dilettante to be eccentric and outspoken. He or she has had
plenty of time to learn how to be charming and sophisticated; what
else has been done with that time betrays the dilettanteÅfs true character.
Lacking financial compulsion, his or her family relations are sometimes
very odd. Can be male or female.]]},

{"DOCTOR OF MEDICINE",[[perhaps a general practitioner, a surgeon
or other specialist, a psychiatrist, or (especially in the 1890s and 1920s)
an independent medical researcher. Apart from personal goals, three
aims",helping patients, gaining money and prestige, and promoting a
more rational and wiser society", are common to the occupation.
Doctors tend to be self-sufficient sorts for whom families become
adjuncts to respectability. A successful practice requires dedication
and much time. May be male or female. By the present day female
physicians are no longer unusual.]]},

{"DRIFTER",[[as opposed to someone who is poverty-stricken, the
drifterÅfs wandering life is chosen, perhaps compensating for social,
philosophical, sexual, or economic lacks. The drifter takes jobs, sometimes
for months, but he is disposed to solve problems with the answer
of mobility and isolation, not comfort and intimacy. The life of the road
might seem especially American, but the same sort of life is chosen
wherever travel itself is not systematically dangerous. Because the road
can be perilous and is without organized protection, the
drifter is often male.]]},

{"ENTERTAINER",[[this occupation might include dancer,
singer, juggler, athlete, musician, or anyone else who earns a
living in front of an audience. These people love to be seen,
love to show what they do best, and love the consequent
applause. These proclivities can be observed in children as
young as age three or four, but the talent that reaps success
may lie fallow for years. Show-business families make excellent
incubators. May be male or female. This profession is
not often respectable in the 1890s, but the money which
Hollywood stars make in the 1920s changes most
minds, and by the present day such a background is
generally felt to be an advantage.]]},

{"JOURNALIST",[[uses words to report and comment
upon topics and incidents of the day, writing as many
words in a day as an author may in a week.
Journalists work for newspapers, magazines,
and radio and television
news services. The best report, but
keep themselves independent of
the corruption and self-serving they
witness. That reality overwhelms the worst,
who eventually forfeit any sensibility except
the power of their words. Nearly always male in
earlier eras, interchangeably male or female by the
present day.]]},

{"MISSIONARY",[[has accepted the call to spread
the word of God. May be independent of all
except his or her own vision, or may be
backed by some organization to do just that", and in that case has
demonstrated some ability to perform such duties. The clear-sighted
missionary is able to focus on the humanity of converts and does not
confuse alien customs with human souls, so that questions of dress,
behavior, or diet do not become paramount. Where morality leaves off
and religion begins is by no means clear. This occupation requires settled
emotions and a sense of humor. The successful missionary
remains personally humble and exalts god. Christian and Islamic proselytizers
are encountered worldwide in all the eras, as are certain other
sects, and as are Buddhist and Hindu teachers in the 1920s and the
present. The missionary is of either sex.]]},

{"PARAPSYCHOLOGIST",[[prestigious universities grant no degrees
for parapsychology. Standards in the field are based entirely upon personal
reputation, and so the most acceptable representatives tend to
hold degrees in related areas", physics, psychology, or medicine. Who
chooses this study is unusually sympathetic to the notion of invisible
mystical powers, and in validating that belief to the satisfaction of
physical scientists. This would represent an unusual cohabitation of
faith and doubt", the parapsychologist may have difficulty separating
the conflicting desires. A person uninterested in observation, experiment,
and proof is not a scientist, though he or she may be an occultist.]]},

{"POLICE DETECTIVE",[[though present day detectives may attend
police science classes, take a degree, and undergo special training and
endless civil service exams, police detectives of every era are grounded
in their experiences as junior officers and ordinary patrolmen.
Police routine and discipline becomes vital to self-identification as
well as an ongoing source of frustration as the detective is tempted by
extralegal shortcuts to successful arrests. The police detective may be
a manager who coordinates staff in some important investigation, but
rarely has the luxury of concentrating on a single case. In the United
States, his responsibilities at any one time may number in the dozens
or hundreds of open cases. The detectiveÅfs crucial function is to marshal
enough evidence to allow an arrest, in turn leading to a successful
criminal prosecution. Detectives everywhere sort truth from lies by
evidence and reconstruction. The offices of detective and prosecutor
are everywhere separate, so that the evidence may be weighed independently
before trial. More recently in the United States, women have
become detectives, but the profession before then was almost exclusively
male.]]},

{"PRIVATE EYE",[[in most places the private investigator is licensed by
the police and must be privately bonded as well, guarantees of
minimal honesty. Proven malfeasance costs him his
license and puts him out of business. The private eye
usually acts in non-police situations: he gathers
information and evidence for private clients
in impending civil cases, tracks down fleeing
spouses or business partners, or acts
as an agent for private defense attorneys
in criminal cases. In detective classics, the private
eye is hired to handle some ordinary civil
or private matter (such as a cheating spouse),
and then is drawn into the investigation of a
murder or series of murders as the case
unfolds. Like any professional, the private eye
separates his personal feelings from the job
at hand, and cheerfully works for the guilty and
innocent alike, as long as his fee is paid. The private
investigator is usually shown to have been a member
of a police force in the past, using those
connections to his advantage in the present.
Usually he is not prosperous and never has
known much money, but his private code
and keen awareness purifiy his manners.
Depending on state or on local law, police
experience may not be necessary. A higher proportion
of women act as private eyes than as
police detectives.]]},

{"PROFESSOR",[[for the most part the occupation indicates a
Ph.D. That rank can earn tenure at universities around the
world. He is qualified to teach and to perform competent research,
and has a discernible academic reputation in his area of expertise. He
may be an absolute idiot in other fields, of course, and such contradictory
investigators are fun to play. Unless they are of independent
means, and have taken leave of their universities, professor-investigators
tend to be tethered close to home by their ongoing responsibilities
to school and students. Indiana Jones was lucky to have a department
head who would allow extended absences", your investigator may not
have such an understanding boss. A small minority of female scholars
existed in each era, but even in the present day male bastions such as
Engineering exist in which female academics are rare.]]},

{"TRIBAL MEMBER",[[in the sense of family allegiance, at least, tribalism
is everywhere. In a tribe the primacy of kinship and custom is selfevident.
A tribal group is relatively small. In place of a blanket of law
and general individual rights, the tribal personality defers to personal
honor. Allegiance to the group shines from within. Praise, vengeance,
gifts, and glory", all must be personal to him or her, and if leaders or
enemies are to be treated as men of honor, they too must be personally
known in some way. The notion of ÅgexileÅh has real power in such a
setting. In the United States, the concept of the tribe as a mutual frame
of mind developed during the 1960s, and the notion of the urban tribe
or even a tribal nation has become more and more synonymous with
the sullen friction between the new paganism and active Christian
fundamentalism.]]},

{"ZEALOT",[[intense and vision-driven, scorning an easy life, the
zealot agitates for a better life for humanity or for some advantage
for the group imagined to be the most worthwhile part of
humanity. Some promote their beliefs through violence, but the
peaceable majority will be just as implacable. All dream of the
vindication of their beliefs. The zealot is not typically young or
old, and a good chance exists for a female counterpart
to the male.]]}};
