playstyles={{"Accumulate Information",[[ 
First, the investigators should determine what they are up
against. This may involve going to the library, speaking with
local residents, trying to obtain journals and diaries of those
involved, and weighing reports of the problem, perhaps with
the help of arcane books. To save time, split up the group and
look in different places, as long as it seems safe.
Often newspapers and diaries have pertinent information.
Libraries, newspaper files, state and local records of births and
deaths, historical societies, hospitals and schools, individual
doctors and lawyers, ministers and priests, and private organizations
like chambers of commerce among others! may
offer information which proves lifesaving in retrospect. Don`t
worry too much about choosing the right place to look: listen
closely to your keeper, who`ll be dropping clues.
Many times published scenarios include quotations, excerpts,
statements, or letters which are given to the players to study and
interpret. These materials always contain clues or potentially useful
information or they would not be handed out.
Question local inhabitants carefully and try to befriend the
nonplayer-characters whom your investigators meet. Consider
what they have to say. Even if they know nothing now, they may
be of help in the future. As detectives of the supernatural, investigators
should proceed cautiously and try to make allies.
Anything could be out there.]]},

{"At The Scene",[[  
At the scene of an investigation or disturbance, the investigators
should comb the area for clues, looking in desks and dressers, inspecting the clothing and belongings of victims, and attempting
to arrive at a realistic picture of what happened. If important
information is to be found, the keeper will be patient with player
queries and rolls. If nothing is to be found, then the keeper so
advises the players. However, the way that such queries and
responses are phrased may be significant.
Take precautions and stay together where danger has been:
something as bad or worse might return. If that Something
does return, and there is no easy way to handle It, do not hesitate
to run. Your feet are your friends. Your investigator can
always return later.]]},

{"Make A Plan",[[ 
When you understand the situation, make a plan to deal with
the problem. Novice players should not assume that the danger
is too much to face any competent keeper will try to match
the dangers to the party`s capabilities, unless he or she has
already clearly warned of the over-match.
If disaster occurs and eldritch horrors overwhelm the party,
those who can should flee and leave the scenario as `a story better
left untold!Ó If the keeper consents, the players might attempt
the same scenario later on, when they feel more confident and
their investigators are better able to handle themselves. Of
course, the keeper is within his rights to beef up the monsters
and dangers of the scenario. After all, the horror has had that
much more time to grow.]]},

{"Use Your Head",[[  
The cheapest and safest way to emerge victorious is to use
brain power. In many published scenarios, a way exists for the
investigators to solve or dispel the problem with little or no
physical combat, though Sanity may need risking.
As a rule of thumb, pursue physical combat against creatures
who have already made physical attacks. Other-wise rely
on repeating the words from the manuscript, breaking the mirror
that the tracks lead through, melting down the dire statuette,
and so on. If the investigators find out that a grisly demon
inhabits the old rickety mine shaft, they need not climb down it
again and get eaten or struck permanently insane. They could
set fire to the mine supports, dynamite the shaft, or pour concrete
into the opening, thus burying the threat, perhaps forever.]]},

{"Different Investigators",[[  
Are any investigators specialists? One handy sort is the wise old
professor who knows foreign languages, reads arcane manuscripts,
and pieces together Sanity-blasting spells able to send
the Elder Horrors back whence they came. He or she is typically
of little use if a fight develops, and generally has low Sanity
points, due to intensive study of the Mythos.
An opposite sort is the tough operator able to fight well
with fists or guns. He or she should leave the eldritch as-pects
of the Mythos to others and remain a bodyguard and scout. He
or she can be helpful with police and gangsters.
Still another sort is the investigator who can do things. He or
she drives very well, maybe pilots an airplane, has good mechanical
and electrical repair skills, and might be a wizard with locks.
Yet another sort could be the street-wise investigator who knows
the floaters and drifters of a city, and who has a tongue glib
enough to keep good relations with them.
Many types could be proposed. No one investigator can
learn to do everything or be prepared for all eventualities. But
they can act in balanced groups and approach adventures in
ways that compensate for individual deficiencies.]]},

{"Multiple Investigators",[[  
Knowing that no one can do everything certainly argues for as
many investigators as possible on a case, but the keeper will be
reluctant to deal with hordes of investigators scurrying about,
looking under everything and asking dozens of questions at
the same time.
Though some players find it distasteful to roleplay more
than one investigator at a time, others can play two or three
investigators without much trouble. If the keeper is willing and
if you wish to, take two investigators per player.
This widens the pool of skills and experiences, and keeps a
player in the action if one investigator goes insane or is seriously
injured. And if (as never should be done if danger threatens)
the investigator team splits up `You guys guard the
plane, while we look in the cave!Ó then one investigator
belonging to the same player can be in each place, again with
the benefit of keeping everyone in the game. That`s why they
bothered to come in the first place.]]},

{"Avoid Gunfights",[[  
Every group of players has its own feel and customs. If gangsters
and foreign spies are common features in a campaign, all
the investigators probably carry concealed weapons for selfdefense.
The number of devastating weapons floating about in
the 1990s practically demands sidearms. On the other
hand, in a campaign in which the investigators devote
most of their time to studying the grislier mysteries of the
Cthulhu Mythos, the only use for a gun may be to shoot oneself
if in danger of permanent madness.
By all means have lots of firearms. But do not rely on
firearms. Most powerful monsters are not harmed by gunfire,
explosions, and such. They are genuinely alien creatures from
vaults of space-time very different from ours. If the plan is to
shoot `em until they die, that plan will not work. Try another
plan first.
Volleys of gunfire tend to attract police, the state militia, Gmen,
and everyone with a stake in law and order. If the
investigators happen to assassinate the local priest
of Yog-Sothoth without first convincing the
police of the necessity, they will certainly
be questioned and arrested,
almost certainly be convicted,
and probably end up
on death row.
Further, observant keepers will notice
that if the investigators` response to difficulties is to shoot their
way out. Many will react accordingly. Three or four gun-slinging
worshipers of Yig could well prove more than the investigators
would like to handle. In Call of Cthulhu, as in the real
world, guns are lethal. Avoid them.]]}
